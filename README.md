# SQLite shell builder

Builds and publishes SQLite shell for different OS:

-   Ubuntu 20.04 shell. Because for some reason "Linux Shell" from SQLite website does not work on Ubuntu ðŸ¤·
-   Windows shell (64-bit). Because SQLite website only provides 32-bit shell ðŸ¤·
-   macOS shell. Just for convenience.

Latest release: [3.35.3](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlite/releases/latest)
